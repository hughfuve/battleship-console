battleship-console 
==================

Working console battleship game project to experiment with STRUCT and typedef in C.

I deliberately tried to avoid the use of classes and CPP but seems I couldnt help myself
when it came to vectors and strings. 

runs under windows using pdcurses ... needs the pdcurses.dll (included in bin)

tested with gcc 4.8.1 on windows
untested on linux .. you'll need to resolve the curses.h requirement

See description.txt for how the program was constructed.
