battleship-console 
==================

Example console battleship game project to experiment with STRUCT and typedef in C.
was deliberately trying to avoid the use of classes and CPP but seems I couldnt help myself
when it came to vectors and strings. 

runs under windows using pdcurses ... 
tested with gcc 4.8.1
Tried to make it so it could compile under anything with minimal tweaks.
